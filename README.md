# PyRain
A python Compression/Encryption code.

This is a python Tool that can be run from the command line And it currently can use a custom method to convert data into a unique format that is then further commpressed using the zlib libary.

Example:
I love cherrys when they are sprinkled with fairy dust and when this line is used by PyRain.  Times a lot   (7.9 kib)
Compressed data --- 1 kib
